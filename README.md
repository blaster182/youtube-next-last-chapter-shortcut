This script is a modified version of youtubeChapterRewind that you can find here: https://github.com/miyliyevr/youtubeChapterRewind

The modifications are for compatiblity only, and modify some functionality like timestamp search realiability.

The purpose was to make some changes so it would work here for personal use, using an AI assistant.

The AI proposed some changes by itself. If it works, it works.
